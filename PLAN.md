# Minecraft Mod: nullExistance

## Core Concepts

This mod introduces a character selection system that grants players unique abilities. Once a character is chosen, the decision is permanent for that world.

## Characters

### 1. MemaroX

*   **Abilities:** To be determined.

### 2. GiXo IV

*   **Ability: Midnight Empowerment**
    *   As the in-game time approaches midnight (18000 ticks), GiXo IV's strength increases.
    *   The strength bonus peaks at midnight.
    *   The strength bonus decreases as the time moves away from midnight.

## Character Selection

*   Upon entering a world for the first time, the player will be prompted to choose a character.
*   The chosen character is bound to the player for the lifetime of that world.
